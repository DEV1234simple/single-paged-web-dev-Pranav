### (You can also call discord bot landing page with some owner information and project showcase)
I always like to try something unique (cap hahaha) ðŸ¤¡.
Provided Theme:
- landing page for a discord bot
- personal website/portfolio 

2 theme fak man... So I am so faking confused which theme should i work on.. then i dicided to create a ladning page for my upcoming discord bot and as well as win this contest ðŸ•º.

So basically this a simple single page website for my upcoming discord bot and also with some extra personal data (portfolio type but not portfolio)

## Features

- Clean and minimal design (may be previously i told this to Shisui San on one of his live that i love clean and minimal design)
- Simple project gallery.
- Cool heading and dedicated features section.
- Another image gallery for bot screenshots.
- Dark mode support hehe (it's 2022 idk why i mention that).
